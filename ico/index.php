                        <h2>1. Principles</h2>
                        <p>
                            By transferring Ether (“ETH”) to the Dentacoin Smart Contract or purchasing
                            Dentacoin (“DCN”) against Bitcoin (“BTC”) or another currency on the supporting
                            exchange platforms and thus receiving Dentacoin Tokens (“DCN”) in return, the User
                            understands and accepts that the User makes a contribution for the development of
                            the Dentacoin project (“Contribution”), further described in the Dentacoin Whitepaper.
                            For the Whitepaper and/or further information on Dentacoin, visit: <a href="https://dentacoin.com/" target="_blank">https://dentacoin.com/</a>.
                            The information contained in the Whitepaper and on the
                            website are of descriptive nature only, are not binding and do – unless explicitly
                            referred to herein – not form part of the Terms as set forth under para 5 below.
                          <br><br>
                            The User understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including
                            Dentacoin Foundation, assigned to this task will make reasonable efforts to develop
                            and complete the Dentacoin project, it is possible that such development may fail and
                            User’s DCN become useless and/or valueless due to technical, commercial,
                            regulatory or any other reasons (see also section 5 regarding Risks).                          
                          <br><br>
                            The User is also aware of the risk that even if all or parts of the Dentacoin project are
                            successfully developed and released in full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest,
                            the Dentacoin project could be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially
                            unsuccessful or shut down for lack of interest, regulatory or other reasons.
                            <strong>The User therefore understands and accepts that the transfer of ETH to the Dentacoin
                            Smart Contract and the distribution of DCN by the Smart Contract, as well as
                            the purchase of DCN on the supporting exchange platforms, carry significant
                            financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the complete loss of
                            value of created DCN if any, and attributed features of the Dentacoin project).</strong>
                          <br><br>
                            By transferring ETH to the Dentacoin Smart Contract, the User expressly agrees to
                            all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Smart Contract Code existing on the
                            Ethereum blockchain (at the addresses set forth under para 4) and in this document
                            (together the “Terms”), which is incorporated by reference herein. This document
                            does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and
                            does not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a share/equity offering and
                            does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. It is a
                            description of the functionality of the Smart Contract.
                          <br><br>
                            By transferring ETH to the Smart Contract or purchasing DCN on the supporting
                            exchange platforms and receiving DCN in return, no form of partnership, joint venture
                            or any similar relationship between the Users and Dentacoin Foundation and/or other
                            individuals or entities involved with the deployment of the Smart Contract and the
                            setting up of the Dentacoin project is created.
                          <br><br>
                            The Contribution into the Smart Contract will not involve any fiat currencies and will
                            strictly be done in cryptocurrencies (ETH). The purchase of DCN will be supported by
                            several exchange platforms described on the official website of Dentacoin.

                            000 DCN, all of equal value and functionality.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Disstribution Rate:</strong> The Smart Contract System will allocate 2 500 000 DCN for
                            every Contribution of 1 ETH. Additionally, on the supporting exchange platforms 1
                            BTC will buy 33 000 000 DCN.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Minimum Purchase Requirements:</strong> Purchases of less than 10 DCN do not result in the allocation of DCN.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Contribution Period:</strong> The Contribution Period starts on 1
                            st of October 2017 (2:00
                            p.m. GMT) and ends on 1
                            st of November 2017 (2:00 p.m. GMT) or when the Hard
                            Cap is reached - whichever is earlier.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Allocation of DCN through the Smart Contract:</strong> The allocation of DCN is initiated
                            by the User sending an amount of ETH to the Dentacoin Smart Contract, located on
                            the Ethereum blockchain at the address set forth under para 4, which triggers a
                            smart contract operation. After the confirmation of the transaction, the Smart Contract
                            creates and allocates the corresponding DCN to the User’s wallet address, from
                            where the ETH were sent from. User must assure to make his contribution using an
                            ETH address to which the Smart Contract System can send back DCN and/or ETH to
                            (e.g. not an address of a currency exchange like Coinbase, Bittrex, Kraken, Poloniex
                            etc.). Issuance of DCN (meaning that respective entries of the Public Key (PUK) of
                            User) are made by the Smart Contract on the blockchain according to the allocation
                            information in the Smart Contract.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>No Refund:</strong> The User understands and accepts that all Contributions for DCN are
                            final and may not be reversed, except in case Contributions have surpassed the Hard
                            Cap (see para 11). User therefore shall assure to make his Contribution using an
                            ETH address to which the Dentacoin Smart Contract can send back DCN and/or
                            ETH to (e.g. not an address of a currency exchange like Coinbase, Bittrex, Kraken,
                            Poloniex etc.). Other Contributions are non-refundable. By contributing for DCN, the
                            User acknowledges that he has no right to request a refund for any reason, and that
                            the User will not receive money or other compensation for any DCN that is not used
                            or remains unused.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Assure to use the original Smart Contracts:</strong> Only the Smart Contract(s) existing at
                            the address set forth under para 4 will issue DCN during the Contribution Period.
                            Access to this Smart Contract will be available through
                            0x08d32b0da63e2C3bcF8019c9c5d849d7a9d791e6. To the extent that any thirdparty
                            website, service or smart-contract offers DCN during the Contribution Period
                            and/or facilitates the allocation or transfer of DCN in any way during the Contribution
                            Period, such third-party websites or services are not authorised by Dentacoin
                            Foundation and have no relationship in any way with Dentacoin Foundation.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Early Termination of the Contribution Period:</strong> During the Contribution Period,
                            Dentacoin Foundation may at any time stop the contribution function at its own
                            discretion and thereby end the Contribution procedure, in particular for security
                            reasons.

                        <h3>2.3 DCN Functionality</h3>
                        <p>
                            DCN are only for use in connection with the Dentacoin project under the terms of the
                            Dentacoin Smart Contract and only constitute a transferable representation of
                            attributed functions specified in the Smart Contract.                        
                          <br><br>
                            DCN is a usage token, which enables users to participate in the Dentacoin Network.
                            Furthermore, certain governance functions may be implemented. If such governance
                            functions exist, at least at the beginning, Dentacoin Foundation has the final decision
                            power regarding all matters discussed.
                          <br><br>
                            User understands and accepts that subject to a decision of the DCN holders based
                            on a governance mechanism, an inflation mechanism (e.g. for staking rewards etc.)
                            may be implemented in the future.
                          <br><br>
                            Ownership of DCN carries no rights express or implied other than the right to use
                            DCN as a mean to enable usage of and interaction with and within the Dentacoin
                            Network, if successfully completed and deployed (see section 3). Beyond this,
                            ownership of DCN carries no rights express or implied. In particular, User
                            understands and accepts that he has no right to claim as holder of DCN any
                            intellectual property rights, equity or equivalent rights or any other form of
                            participation in or relating to the Dentacoin project, Dentacoin Network and/or
                            Dentacoin Foundation.

                            access to his DCN;
                          <br><br>
                            • User understands and accepts, that if he exceeds with his Contribution the
                            Hard Cap as described within para 11, the total amount of his Contribution will

                            password is used to encrypt the User’s private key. Following the distribution of DCN
                            by the Smart Contract, the DCN will be transferred to the User's address. The User
                            understands that the User must keep his password and private key safe and that the
                            User may not share them with anybody. The User further understands that if his
                            private key and/or password is lost or stolen, the User will not be able to generate a
                            new password or recover his private key, and if the User also loses his private keys
                            and password, the DCN associated with the User's account (address) will be
                            unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. Furthermore, the User understands that
                            there is no recovery mechanism for lost keys and passwords, so no one will be able
                            to help the User retrieve or reconstruct a lost password and private keys and provide
                            the User with access to any lost DCN.

                            received during the Contribution Period. Dentacoin Foundation shall further have the
                            right to assign the Dentacoin project including the Contributions received for its
                            development to a third party.

                            The User understands and accepts that for the purpose of the development and
                            execution of the Dentacoin project, Dentacoin Foundation receives the full amount of
                            ETH transferred to the Smart Contract during the Contribution Period. This amount
                            covers expenses, charges and other costs that may arise by Dentacoin Foundation
                            and/or its subcontractors as part of the development and execution of the Dentacoin
                            project. Dentacoin Foundation has the right to support and/or acquire other
                            companies for the benefit of successfully developing the Dentacoin project. It
                            remains at Dentacoin Foundation’s sole discretion to decide how to allocate the
                            funds in order to develop and execute the Dentacoin project.

                            The User understands and accepts that the Dentacoin project will need to go through
                            substantial development works as part of which it may become subject of significant
                            conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. User understands
                            and accepts that as part of the development, an upgrade of the DCN may be
                            required (hard-fork of DCN) and that, if User decides not to participate in such
                            upgrade, he may no longer use his DCN and that non upgraded DCN may lose their
                            functionality in full.

                        <h2>4. Audit of the Smart Contract</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Smart Contract has been, on a reasonable effort basis, audited and approved by
                            technical experts. The technical experts have confirmed that the Smart Contract has,
                            with regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed according to the current
                            state of the art.                        
                          <br><br>
                            However, the User understands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in
                            an early development stage and its application of experimental nature which carries
                            significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks.
                            Accordingly, while the audit conducted raises the level of security and accuracy, the
                            User understands and accepts that the audit does not amount to any form of
                            warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Smart Contract and the DCN
                            are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or
                            bugs which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH and/or DCN.

                        <h2>5. Risks</h2>
                        <p>
                            The User understands and accepts the risks in connection with transferring ETH to
                            the Smart Contract and creating DCN as exemplary set forth above and hereinafter.
                            In particular, but not concluding, the User understands the inherent risks listed
                            hereinafter:
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk of software weaknesses:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the Smart
                            Contract concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the
                            Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven, why there
                            is no warranty that the process for creating DCN will be uninterrupted or error-free
                            and why there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses,
                            vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH and/or DCN.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology
                            allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will
                            apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain
                            technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the
                            Smart Contract and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the
                            Smart Contract and/or the Dentacoin project, including its termination and the loss of
                            DCN for the User.                          
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk of abandonment / lack of success:</strong> The User understands and accepts that
                            the distribution of the DCN and the development of the Dentacoin project may be
                            abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of
                            funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing
                            projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the
                            Dentacoin project is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive
                            any benefits through the DCN held by him.                          
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk associated with other applications:</strong> The User understands and accepts that
                            the Dentacoin project may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by
                            unaffiliated third parties, under which DCN will have no intrinsic value.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk of loss of private key:</strong> DCN can only be accessed by using an Ethereum
                            wallet with a combination of User’s account information (address), private key and
                            password. The private key is encrypted with a password. The User understands and
                            accepts that if his private key file or password respectively got lost or stolen, the
                            obtained DCN associated with the User's account (address) or password will be
                            unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk of theft:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the Smart Contract concept,
                            the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum
                            blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that could
                            result in theft or loss of DCN and/or ETH, impacting the ability to develop the
                            Dentacoin project.
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk of Ethereum mining attacks:</strong> The User understands and accepts that, as with
                            other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract is susceptible to
                            mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining
                            power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful
                            attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract, expected proper execution and
                            sequencing of DCN transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of
                            contract computations.                          
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk of governance attacks and failure:</strong> The Contributor understands and accepts
                            that the Dentacoin Network may use an in-built decentralized governance system
                            (“Governance System”). For these reasons, it is possible that the Governance
                            System adopts proposals that have an adverse effect on the useful functioning of the
                            Dentacoin Network and/or the value of DCN. If the Governance System is attacked,
                            or becomes controlled either directly or indirectly by some party who makes unwise
                            decisions, or the community generally makes unwise decisions, the value of DCN
                            held by a Contributor might be greatly reduced or even permanently lost.                          
                          <br><br>
                            <strong>Risk of incompatible Wallet service:</strong> The User understands and accepts, that the
                            wallet or wallet service provider used for the contribution, has to be technically
                            compatible with the DCN. The failure to assure this may have the result that User will
                            not gain access to his DCN.

                        <p>
                            The User bears the sole responsibility to determine if his contribution into the Smart
                            Contract for the development of the Dentacoin project, the transfer of ETH, the
                            allocation, ownership or use of DCN, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the
                            value of DCN over time (if any), the allocation of DCN and/or any other action or
                            transaction related to the Dentacoin project have tax implications for him.

                            control of the Smart Contract. The User understands that a majority of these miners
                            could agree at any point to make changes to the official Smart Contract and to run
                            the new version of the Smart Contract. Such a scenario could lead to DCN losing
                            intrinsic value.
