                        <h2>1. Principles</h2>
                        <p>
                          By transferring Ether (“ETH”) to the Smart Contract System and distributing Dentacoin Tokens (“DCN”),
                          the User understands and accepts that the User makes a contribution into a Smart Contract System for
                          the development of the Dentacoin value-creating tools (“Contribution”), further described in the Dentacoin
                          Whitepaper. For the Whitepaper and/or further information on Dentacoin, visit: <a href="https://dentacoin.com/" target="_blank">https://dentacoin.com/</a>.
                          The information contained in the Whitepaper and on the website are of descriptive nature only, are not
                          binding and do – unless explicitly referred to herein – not form part of the Terms as set forth under para 5 below.
                          <br><br>
                          The User understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including Dentacoin Foundation,
                          assigned to this task will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete the Dentacoin tools,
                          <strong>it is possible that such development may fail and User’s DCN become useless and/or valueless
                          due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons </strong> (see also section 5 regarding Risks).
                          <br><br>
                          The User is also aware of the risk that even if all or parts of the Dentacoin tools are successfully
                          developed and released in full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest, the Dentacoin tools could
                          be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially unsuccessful or shut down for lack of interest,
                          regulatory or other reasons.<strong>The User therefore understands and accepts that the transfer of
                          ETH to the Smart Contract System and the distribution of DCN by the Smart Contract System carry
                          significant financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the complete loss of value
                          of created DCN if any, and attributed features of the Dentacoin tools).</strong>
                          <br><br>
                          By transferring ETH to the Smart Contract System, the User expressly agrees to all of the terms and
                          conditions set forth in Smart Contract System Code existing on the Ethereum blockchain (at the addresses
                          set forth under para 4) and in this document (together the “Terms”), which is incorporated by reference
                          herein. This document does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment
                          and does not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a share/equity offering and does not
                          pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. It is a description of the functionality
                          of a Smart Contract System.
                          <br><br>
                          By transferring ETH to the Smart Contract System and receiving DCN, no form of partnership, joint
                          venture or any similar relationship between the Users and Dentacoin Foundation and/or other individuals
                          or entities involved with the deployment of the Smart Contract System and the setting up of the Dentacoin
                          tools is created.
                          <br><br>
                          The Contribution into the Smart Contract System will not involve any fiat currencies and will strictly be
                           done in cryptocurrencies (ETH).
                        </p>
                        <h2>2. DCN Creation Function</h2>
                        <h3>2.1 Usage License; No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights</h3>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Usage License:</strong> Ownership of DCN carries no rights express or implied other than a limited
                          right (license) to use the Dentacoin network (“Dentacoin Network”), if and to the extent the Dentacoin tools
                          has been successfully completed and launched.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights:</strong> In particular, User understands and accepts that
                          <strong>DCN do not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights
                          nor any right to receive future revenues, shares or any other form of participation or governance right
                          in or relating to the Dentacoin tools or the Dentacoin Foundation.</strong>
                          <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.2 Contribution</h3>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Contribution Cap:</strong> The total amount of Contributions will be hard-capped to 10 000 ETH.
                          Contributions (pending or transacted) exceeding the respective Hard Cap, will not be accepted as Contributions
                          (in total, not just the exceeding part). Once the Hard Cap has been reached, the Contribution Period ends.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Token Pool:</strong> At the end of the Contribution Period, an amount of max. 80 000 000 000 DCN
                          is planned to be distributed by the Smart Contract System, all of equal value and functionality.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Creation Rate:</strong> The Smart Contract System will allocate 8 000 000 DCN for every Contribution of 1 ETH.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Minimum Purchase Requirements:</strong> Purchases of less than 10 DCN do not result in the allocation of DCN.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Contribution Period:</strong> The Contribution Period starts on 1st of July 2017 (8:00 a.m. GMT)
                          and ends on 1st of August 2017 (8:00 a.m. GMT) or when the Hard Cap is reached - whichever is earlier.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Creation and Allocation of DCN:</strong> The creation and allocation of DCN is initiated by the
                          User sending an amount of ETH to the Smart Contract System, located on the Ethereum blockchain at the
                          address set forth under para 4, which triggers a smart contract operation. After the confirmation of the
                          transaction, the Smart Contract System creates and allocates the corresponding DCN to the User’s wallet
                          address, from where the ETH were sent from. User must assure to make his contribution using an ETH address
                          to which they hold the according private key (e.g. not an address of a currency exchange
                          like Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex or wallets that doesn't support Dentacoin tokens yet e.g. Jaxx).
                          Issuance of DCN (meaning that respective entries of the Public Key
                          (PUK) of User) are made by the Smart Contract System on the blockchain according to the allocation information
                          in the Smart Contract System.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>No Refund:</strong> The User understands and accepts that all Contributions for DCN are final and may
                          not be reversed, except in case Contributions have surpassed the Hard Cap (see para 11). User therefore shall
                          assure to make his Contribution using an ETH address
                          to which they hold the according private key (e.g. not an address of a currency exchange
                          like Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex or wallets that doesn't support Dentacoin tokens yet e.g. Jaxx). Other Contributions are
                          non-refundable. By contributing for DCN, the User acknowledges that he has no right to request a refund for any
                          reason, and that the User will not receive money or other compensation for any DCN that is not used or remains unused.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Assure to use the original Smart Contracts:</strong> Only the Smart Contract(s) existing at the address
                          set forth under para 4 will issue DCN during the Contribution Period. Access to this Smart Contract will be
                          available through 0x08d32b0da63e2C3bcF8019c9c5d849d7a9d791e6. To the extent that any third-party website,
                          service or smart-contract offers DCN during the Contribution Period and/or facilitates the allocation or transfer
                          of DCN in any way during the Contribution Period, such third-party websites or services are not authorised by
                          Dentacoin Foundation and have no relationship in any way with Dentacoin Foundation.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Early Termination of the Contribution Period:</strong> During the Contribution Period, Dentacoin Foundation
                          may at any time stop the contribution function at its own discretion and thereby end the Contribution procedure,
                          in particular for security reasons.
                          <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.3 DCN Functionality</h3>
                        <p>
                          DCN are only for use in connection with the Dentacoin tools under the terms of the Smart Contract System and

                          DCN is a usage token, which enables to participate in the Dentacoin Network. Furthermore, certain governance
                          functions may be implemented. If such governance functions exist, at least at the beginning, Dentacoin Foundation
                          has the final decision power regarding all matters discussed.
                          <br><br>
                          User understands and accepts that subject to a decision of the DCN holders based on a governance mechanism, an
                          inflation mechanism (e.g. for staking rewards etc.) may be implemented in the future.
                          <br><br>
                          Ownership of DCN carries no rights express or implied other than the right to use DCN as a mean to enable usage
                          of and interaction with and within the Dentacoin Network, if successfully completed and deployed (see section 3).
                          Beyond this, ownership of DCN carries no rights express or implied. In particular, User understands and accepts
                          that he has no right to claim as holder of DCN any intellectual property rights, equity or equivalent rights or
                          any other form of participation in or relating to the Dentacoin tools, Dentacoin Network and/or Dentacoin Foundation.

                          the DCN to the Users as proposed by these Terms. The User understands and accepts that the consensus mechanism
                          securing the Ethereum Network may change in the future, and the stakeholders who are in control of the Network may
                          also change as a result.
                          <br><br>
                          the User has carefully reviewed the code of the Smart Contract System located on the Ethereum blockchain at the

                          User will contribute ETH from a wallet respectively within a wallet or wallet service provider that technically
                          supports the DCN. User understands and accepts, that failure to assure this may have the result that User will not
                          gain access to his DCN;
                          <br><br>
                          User understands and accepts, that if he exceeds with his Contribution the Hard Cap as described within para 11,
                          the total amount of his Contribution will not be accepted by the Smart Contract System. User further understands
                          and accepts, that in such case the Gas necessary for the transaction will be lost.
                          <br><br>
                          the User is legally permitted to receive software and contributing to the Smart Contract System for the development
                          of the Dentacoin tools;
                          <br><br>
                          the User is of a sufficient age to legally create and obtain DCN;
                          <br><br>
                          the User will take sole responsibility for any restrictions and risks associated with the creation of DCN by the
                          Smart Contract System as set forth below;
                          <br><br>
                          the User is not submitting ETH to the Smart Contract System to obtain DCN for the purpose of speculative investment;

                          the User is purchasing the functionality of the DCN issued by the Smart Contract System primarily to support the
                          development, testing, deployment and operation of the Dentacoin tools, being aware of the commercial risks
                          associated with the Dentacoin tools;
                          <br><br>
                          the User waives the right to participate in a class action lawsuit or a classwide arbitration against Dentacoin
                          Foundation or any individual involved with the creation of DCN;
                          <br><br>
                          the User understands the creation of DCN does not involve the purchase of shares or any equivalent in any
                          existing or future public or private company, corporation or other entity in any jurisdiction;
                          <br><br>
                          the User understands that the transfer of ETH to the Smart Contract System, the creation of DCN and the development
                          of the Dentacoin tools carries significant financial, regulatory and reputational risks as further set forth in the Terms;
                          <br><br>
                          the User understands and expressly accepts that there is no warranty whatsoever on DCN, the Smart Contract System
                          and/or the success of the Dentacoin tools, expressed or implied, to the extent permitted by law, and that the Smart
                          Contract System is used and DCN are created and obtained at the sole risk of the User on an “as is” and “under
                          development” basis and without, to the extent permitted by law, any warranties of any kind, including, but not
                          limited to, warranties of title or implied warranties, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose;
                          <br><br>
                          the User understands that the User has no right against any other party to request any refund of the ETH submitted
                          to the Smart Contract System for the creation of the DCN under any circumstance;
                          <br><br>
                          the User understands with regard to DCN no market liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value of DCN over time may
                          experience extreme volatility or depreciate in full;
                          <br><br>
                          the User understands that the User bears the sole responsibility to determine if the User’s contribution to the Smart
                          Contract System for the development of the Dentacoin tools, the transfer of ETH to the Smart Contract System, the
                          creation, ownership or use of DCN, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of DCN over time (if any),
                          the allocation of DCN and/or any other action or transaction related to the Dentacoin tools have tax implications for
                          him; by creating, holding or using DCN, and to the extent permitted by law, the User agrees not to hold any third party
                          (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from
                          the creation, ownership or use of DCN or any other action or transaction related to the Dentacoin tools.
                          <br><br>
                          As part of the contribution process the User will use own account (address) on the Ethereum network, with a private
                          key associated to this address and password. The password is used to encrypt the User’s private key. Following the
                          creation of DCN by the Smart Contract System, the DCN will be transferred to the User's address by the Smart Contract
                          System. The User understands that the User must keep his password and private key safe and that the User may not share
                          them with anybody. The User further understands that if his private key and/or password is lost or stolen, the User
                          will not be able to generate a new password or recover his private key, and if the User also loses his private keys and
                          password, the DCN associated with the User's account (address) will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
                          Furthermore, the User understands that there is no recovery mechanism for lost keys and passwords, so no one will be able
                          to help the User retrieve or reconstruct a lost password and private keys and provide the User with access to any lost DCN.

                        <p>
                          The User understands and accepts that the development and execution of the Dentacoin tools will be assigned to a third
                          party contractor, Dentacoin Foundation, by releasing the amount of contributed ETH by the Smart Contract System to the
                          wallet of Dentacoin Foundation. Dentacoin Foundation has the right to engage subcontractors to perform the entire or
                          partial development and execution of the Dentacoin tools. The scope of the development work will be triggered by the
                          amount of Contributions received during the Contribution Period. Dentacoin Foundation shall further have the right to
                          assign the Dentacoin tools including the Contributions received for its development to a third party.
                          <br><br>
                          The User understands and accepts that for the purpose of the development and execution of the Dentacoin tools, Dentacoin
                          Foundation receives the full amount of ETH transferred to the Smart Contract System during the Contribution Period.
                          This amount covers expenses, charges and other costs that may arise by Dentacoin Foundation and/or its subcontractors as
                          part of the development and execution of the Dentacoin tools. Dentacoin Foundation has the right to support and/or acquire
                          other companies for the benefit of successfully developing the Dentacoin tools. It remains at Dentacoin Foundation’s sole
                          discretion to decide how to allocate the funds in order to develop and execute the Dentacoin tools.
                          <br><br>
                          The User understands and accepts that the User may not have any expectation of influence over governance on the Dentacoin tools.
                          <br><br>
                          The User understands and accepts that the Dentacoin tools will need to go through substantial development works as part
                          of which it may become subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. User understands
                          and accepts that as part of the development, an upgrade of the DCN may be required (hard-fork of DCN) and that, if User
                          decides not to participate in such upgrade, he may no longer use his DCN and that non upgraded DCN may lose their functionality in full.

                        <p>
                          The Smart Contract System has been, on a reasonable effort basis, audited and approved by technical experts. The technical
                          experts have confirmed that the Smart Contract System has, with regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed
                          according to the current state of the art.
                          <br><br>
                          However, the User understands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in an early development stage and its
                          application of experimental nature which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational
                          risks. Accordingly, while the audit conducted raises the level of security and accuracy, the User understands and accepts that
                          the audit does not amount to any form of warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Smart Contract System and
                          the DCN are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which could cause, inter alia,
                          the complete loss of ETH and/or DCN.

                        <h2>5. Risks</h2>
                        <p>
                          The User understands and accepts the risks in connection with transferring ETH to the Smart Contract System and creating DCN as
                          exemplary set forth above and hereinafter. In particular, but not concluding, the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter:
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk of software weaknesses:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying
                          software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven, why
                          there is no warranty that the process for creating DCN will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that
                          the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH and/or DCN.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction
                          and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing,
                          blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may,
                          inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Smart Contract System and/or the Dentacoin tools, including its termination
                          and the loss of DCN for the User.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk of abandonment / lack of success:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the creation of the DCN and the development of the
                          Dentacoin tools may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of
                          commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance
                          that, even if the Dentacoin tools is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive any benefits through the
                          DCN held by him.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk associated with other applications:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the Dentacoin tools may give
                          rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which DCN will have no intrinsic value.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk of loss of private key:</strong> DCN can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of
                          User’s account information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. The User
                          understands and accepts that if his private key file or password respectively got lost or stolen, the obtained DCN associated
                          with the User's account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk of theft:</strong> The User understands and accepts that the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software
                          application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that could
                          result in theft or loss of DCN and/or ETH, impacting the ability to develop the Dentacoin tools.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk of Ethereum mining attacks:</strong> The User understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain
                          used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining
                          power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System,
                          expected proper execution and sequencing of DCN transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk of governance attacks and failure:</strong> The Contributor understands and accepts that the Dentacoin Network may use
                          an in-built decentralized governance system (“Governance System”). For these reasons, it is possible that the Governance System adopts
                          proposals that have an adverse effect on the useful functioning of the Dentacoin Network and/or the value of DCN. If the Governance
                          System is attacked, or becomes controlled either directly or indirectly by some party who makes unwise decisions, or the community
                          generally makes unwise decisions, the value of DCN held by a Contributor might be greatly reduced or even permanently lost.
                          <br><br>
                          <strong>Risk of incompatible Wallet service:</strong> The User understands and accepts, that the wallet or wallet service provider
                          used for the contribution, has to be technically compatible with the DCN. The failure to assure this may have the result that User
                          will not gain access to his DCN.
                          <br><br>

                          Dentacoin tools, the transfer of ETH, the creation, ownership or use of DCN, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value
                          of DCN over time (if any), the allocation of DCN and/or any other action or transaction related to the Dentacoin tools have tax

                          The User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the User will not hold any developers,
                          auditors, contractors or founders of the DCN, the Smart Contract System and/or Dentacoin Foundation liable for any and all damages or

                          The User further specifically acknowledges that developers, auditors, contractors or founders of the DCN, Smart Contract System and/or
                          the Dentacoin tools are not liable, and the User agrees not to seek to hold them liable, for the conduct of third parties, including
                          other creators of DCN, and that the risk of creating, holding and using DCN rests entirely with the User.
                          <br><br>
                          By creating, holding or using DCN, and to the extent permitted by law, the User agrees not to hold any third party (including developers,
                          auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any regulatory implications or liability associated with or arising from the creation,

                        <h2>8. Miscellaneous</h2>
                        <p>
                          The User understands and accepts that the network of miners will be ultimately in control of the Smart Contract System. The User understands
                          that a majority of these miners could agree at any point to make changes to the official Smart Contract System and to run the new version of
                          the Smart Contract System. Such a scenario could lead to DCN losing intrinsic value.
                          <br><br>
                          The Smart Contract System is located in Alderney. Consequently, the DCN creation and allocation and the assignment of the development
                          and execution of the Dentacoin tools to Dentacoin Foundation are considered to be executed in Alderney.
                          <br><br>
                          The User agrees that if any portion of these Terms is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall, as
                          to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting
                          the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms,
                          which shall continue to be in full force and effect.
                          <br><br>
                          The Terms govern the creation, ownership and use of DCN and supersede any public statements about the launch of DCN and/or the Smart
                          Contract System made by anyone in the past, present and future.
                          <br><br>
                          The applicable law is Dutch law. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with the creation of the DCN and the development and execution
                          of the Dentacoin tools shall be finally settled by the ordinary courts of the registered domicile of the defendant.
